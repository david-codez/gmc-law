His experience is much greater than his picture would imply.  They took care of everything. Never had to go to appear or anything. These guys are great.",

      "comment": "Gannon has a welcoming presence that makes you feel appreciated. He truly fights and resolves cases that is in the best interest of his clients. His knowledge of the law supersedes various attorneys I was considering to represent me. If you want an attorney that will not settle for mediocre deals, I would recommend Gannon Cohens.",

      "comment": "At any point in life, we all do something, which we later regret.\nGannon rescued my minor daughter and myself from dire consequences from my \"regrettable action\". \nI do prefer folks who have expertise in their field and are able to combine that with logical thought and action. \nThat is Gannon. In my opinion, he is well versed in his field, does not prolong issues and offers solutions that can fix or alleviate legal issues.  You will save money in the long run by utilizing his services.Thank you for reading my review. Keith Srinivasan",
